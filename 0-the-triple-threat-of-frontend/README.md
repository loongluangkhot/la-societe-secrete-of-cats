# The triple threat of frontend

## Components
1. **html**: skeleton
2. **css**: skin
3. **js**: behaviours

## HTML
- tags
- attributes
- block vs inline

## CSS
- css selector
- specificity (in ascending order)
  - tag
  - class
  - id
  - inline
  - !important
- css variables

## JS
- DOM element
- event driven
- browser engine & global keywords (e.g. document, window)
- imperative programming

## Practice
The initial design of our website leaked out, and there was intense backlash by the public (particularly the foolish dog lovers!) criticising the lack of dog representation.
Please fix:
- Change the title to something less incriminating
- Add a "dog" section to display dog photos. We must pretend to also love 'em dogs.
