## Concepts
- server-rendering
- template engines
- client-server request types: xhr vs non-xhr

## Challenges
Ha's cat, Oliver, spends a lot of his free time browsing our website. He thinks it's a dating app. Oliver is very upset that everytime he clicks "Show me a different cat!", the page flickers. He believes this janky experience is the main obstacle to his success in the love department.
Please fix:
- Instead of reloading the entire page, when the button is clicked, make API calls from the frontend to fetch a new url of cat picture to display on the page
